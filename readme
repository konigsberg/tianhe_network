TIANHE-2 interconnect network is composed of compute nodes and routers.
We implement an electrical-phonic interconnect network.

Features:
(1) Clock integer counter is used to implement the global forward table.
(2) Every upper-side router and lower-side router has local cache of shared
credit memory. Copy-on-write is used to update local credit cache. When a local
credit cache is modified, it send an update exchange message to shared memory,
and share memory broadcast the new credit to all local cache.

Limitations:
(1) To simplify forward table viewed by side routers and optical switch, we set
the byte length of flit to zero.
(2) Credit message is not embedded into flit.

Bug fixed:
(1) Sending credit is skipped when input buffer is empty.
(2) When setting the port in credit message, the calculated output port is used
instead of the actually switched port.
(3) The credit array index is between P/2 and P for upper-side routers.
(4) The clock calculation based on division of double values has precision
error, making some flit blocked even if it's right time to forward.
(5) The router latency is in second unit while the link latency is in nano
second unit.

Bug unfixed:
(1) Lower-side routers have leak memory of credit object, although the credit
messages are deleted in router's destructor.
(2) Low-throughput, possibly high-latency of long trip flits.
(3) If credit message is not embedded into flit, it is possible that the optical
switch could not forward a credit message because all of its ports are busy. So
the credit message maybe dropped, causing serious traffic issue.
(4) The window of forwarding packet can be minimized to packet size.
(5) Downward forwarding can possibly be optimized.
(6) Frequency should be reset to 437.5MHz.
