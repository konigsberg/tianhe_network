Rewrite of NRC class in misc/NRC.
make MODE=debug

Actually there is a bug in NRC.cc:
In the port_allocation function, I commented out the checking for credits. In
the second_virtual_channel_allocation, the credits will be no less than the
PacketLength, but because the second_virtual_channel_allocation is executed
at packet-wise, the ensurement maybe outdated during the packet transmission.
I has not figured out a scheme to solve the bug, so I just commented out the
checking line. It won't cause program crashed because the implementation of
input buffer is deque with variant length.

The bug is not introduced during the re-writing code. The bug is existed all
the time since last December.

The bug has been fixed now.
