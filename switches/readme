Tianhe-2 interconnect network is composed of computing nodes and switches.

This folder contains the OMNeT++ models of switches.

NRC is the basic electronic switch. Each port of NRC is not connected to
optical switch.

LowerNRC locates below the optical switch. LowerNRC is the second layer of
switch of NRM in cabinet.

UpperNRC locates above the optical switch. UpperNRC is the first later of
switch of NRM in root.

OpticalSwitch is the optical switch based on micro-ring resonators, and it
locates between LowerNRC and UpperNRC, say, the third layer switch in the
fat-tree topology.

BaseNRC is the improved NRC in electrical-optical hybrid network. It locates
at the first and fifth layer in the fat-tree topology.

LowerNRC, UpperNRC and BaseNRC implement the flow-control protocols in
electrical-optical hybrid network. NRC use the traditional credit based
flow-control protocols.
